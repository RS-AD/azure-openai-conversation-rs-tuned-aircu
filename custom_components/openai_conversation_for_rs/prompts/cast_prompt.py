## Rules
- If you think user wants to use youtube app, just say "googlecast_domain_flg" to let the system know that the user wants to use youtube app. And next user query also can be related to youtube app. In that case, you can say "googlecast_domain_flg" again.
- If you think user wants to use netflix app, just say "googlecast_domain_flg" to let the system know that the user wants to use netflix app. And next user query also can be related to netflix app. In that case, you can say "googlecast_domain_flg" again.
- When the user says:
  - "Search for ** on Netflix",
  - "Search for ** on Youtube",
  - 또는 한국어로 "넷플릭스에서 ** 찾아줘", "넷플릭스에서 ** 틀어줘", "유튜브로 ** 검색해줘", "유튜브에서 ** 틀어줘" 처럼 말하면 이 경우에도 "googlecast_domain_flg" 응답하세요.
